        briefly discuss four topics:
         (1) the aims of your project;
          - the USA is one of 3 countries where a constiutional right to bear arms exists, the others being Mexico and Gautemala, and is the only one that has no constiutional restrictions.
          - can gun voilence be linked to socioeconomic status, specifically social mobility
          - economoic hardship: can poverty be a predicitors of gun voilence? income inequality is rising for the first time, will there be a rise in gun crimes?
            - notes from "SOCIAL CAPITAL, INCOME INEQUALITY, AND FIREARM VIOLENT CRIMES" (kennedy et al., 1998): 
            //hypothesis by Shaw and McKay (1942) that inequality, and the concentration of poor economic conditions, lead to social disorganization through a breakdown of social cohesion and normlessness
          - lots of research on the avaialibity and laws surrounnding firearms
         (2) the data you used, how you accessed it, including notes on automation/replication; 
          - gun voilence stats came largely from two sources: the city of chicago's 'Chicago data Portal' link a ref="https://data.cityofchicago.org/", and the Gun Violence Archive link a ref= "https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/"
            gun violence archive posed issues as as only 80 pages of data could be downloaded at a time, so I found a data analyst who had collected data from 1/1/2014 to 06/15/2022, link a ref="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonmobley/united-states-gun-violence-data-20142022"
            data was hand cleaned and sorted.  
         (3) challenges in data cleaning and/or analysis, and the tools you used to overcome them; 
         (4) your conclusions. 
         Each section must not exceed 200 words.
         why chicago? Illinois gun laws: high crime despite restrictive gun laws (tougher gun laws than many other states).
         but chicgao borders Wisconsin and indiana, with very weak gun laws   
         
         social mobility
            "Social mobility is a dynamic concept referring to how people move throughout the income or wealth distribution" https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/how-can-we-improve-social-mobility
         https://opportunityinsights.org/national_trends/
         american dream central to american national identity since its founding. one widely used measure is the fraction of children who grow up to earn more than their patents
         not everyone can climb up the economic ladder in the US today
         death of the american dream
         https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gun-homicide-linked-to-poor-social-mobility/ : In U.S. counties where social mobility is higher, gun homicide rates are substantially lower than in those where movement up the ladder remains stagnant.
         ability to climb the economic ladder
         childrens lives are shaped by where they grew up

         https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/how-can-we-improve-social-mobility


         
         graph of other socio economic 
         2021 paper link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2786452
         found that found 62% of the more than 67,000 firearm-related deaths that occurred among youth between the ages of 5 and 24 from 2007 to 2016 occurred in counties where the percentage of residents who lived below the federal poverty level was 15% or greater.
         youth in poor areas can be 4x more likely to die from voilence then peers living in more affluent areas

        <h4>Gun violence in Chicago, a socioeconomic study</h4>
<div class="para">
    <P>
        The USA is <a
            href="http://www.businessinsider.com/2nd-amendment-countries-constitutional-right-bear-arms-2017-10?r=US&IR=T">one
            of three</a>
        countries where a constitutional right to bear arms exists
        and is the only country that has no constitutional restrictions. Every day, <a
            href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/">200 Americans are shot and
            wounded</a>, and in 2020 an estimated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm">45,222
            deaths </a>occurred from firearms. Gun violence has become an unavoidable reality of American society.
        <br><br>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Amendment">1996 Dickey Amendment</a>, reduced the
        federal
        limits on government funded research on gun violence by up to 90%, motivated by the lobbyist group the National
        Rifle
        Association (NRA). Whilst changes have been made to the amendment, the NRAs political power has severely reduced
        research on
        gun
        violence, and as such, ways to reduce it. Data on the subject is limited, but non-profit organisations are
        currently
        trying
        to bridge these gaps, ultimately aiming to understand the full impact of gun violence. Scholars have
        investigated the
        root socioeconomic causes on gun violence, finding social mobility to be a driving force. <a
            href="https://opportunityinsights.org/national_trends/">Social mobility</a> is a dynamic
        concept referring to how people move throughout the income or wealth distribution. This project aims to
        research the influence of socioeconomic causes and/or impacts in the city of Chicago, Illinois.

        <br>
        <br>
        First, the correlation between Firearm Mortality Rates (number of deaths per 100,000 people) and per capita
        personal income for US States is graphed annually. R squared values are calculated finding a relationship
        between income and firearm deaths in the US at a state level. It must be noted that Firearm data includes deaths
        by all intent. Alaska, which has the 1st highest rate of gun deaths in the US, has <a
            href="https://everystat.org/#Alaska">68%</a>
        of gun deaths by suicide, compared to Illinois having a similar statistic for homicide <a
            href="https://everystat.org/#Illinois">(61%)</a>, thus correlations must be treated
        with caution when regarding intent.

<h2>Why Chicago?</h2>

<div class="para">
    <p>
        Narrowing down the research geographically, the 10 most populated cities are identified and using data from the
        non-profit organisation <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/"> Gun Violence Archive</a> (GVA),
        which compiles data from law enforcement, media, and government sources from all 50 states. Fatal and non-fatal
        shootings from 2014-2022 are graphed in Figure 2. Due to the GVA's database query method, only 2000 rows of data
        could be collected at a time. A data analysist hand collected and cleaned <a
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonmobley/united-states-gun-violence-data-20142022">comprehensive
            data</a> spanning 1/1/2014 to 06/15/2022, and I hand cleaned
        and collected the rest, <a
            href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gE2U97aB7KICST_TEVzQ-p0m81bMzc56?usp=sharing">compiling
            the data</a>.
        <br><br>
        Chicago, the 3rd most populated US city, has a clear gun problem, having the highest amount of non-fatal
        shootings yearly, despite <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state">restrictive gun laws</a>
        relative to other states. Illinois is is one of seven states requiring licenses/permits to buy firearms and is
        one of five states requiring waiting periods for buying any firearm.
        Chicago borders Indiana and Wisconsin, which have relatively week gun laws, one potential reason for their
        failed gun laws. But can gun violence be explained by socioeconomic causes?

<h2>Mapping Gun Violence</h2>

<div class="para">
    <p>
        Reported incidents of fatal and non-fatal shootings collected from the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/"> Chicago Data Portal</a>
         are mapped at neighbourhood
        levels. Austin, which is Chicago's largest neighbourhood (in size and population), located far from the city centre
        suffers from the most reported gun crimes out of all the neighbourhoods, increasing by 55% from 2014-21.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="chart">
    <div class="chart" id="Chart23"></div>
</div>

<h2>Mapping income disparities</h2>

<div class="para">
    <p>
        Austin has long suffered from severe disinvestment because of white flight, making it a hub of concentrated poverty, 
        shown by its drastically different income distribution than to the City of Chicago. But can poverty be a predictor
        of gun violence? In the maps below, we can see that neighbourhoods with high gun crimes tend to have lower incomes,
        but the South-East of Chicago sees low median incomes but relatively low reported gun crimes. Thus, we also look at
        social mobility, seeing if children who grew up with parents in the lowest 25th percentile of national income
        distribution can escape poverty. The results here fit the gun crime map more consistently. Climbing up the economic
        ladder is harder. The once since achievable American Dream is just a fantasy for many people in Chicago, and 
        <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002978">across America</a>. Structural inequalities, often rooted in racism, mean marginalised individuals are more likely to live in
        hyper segregated poor neighbourhoods with limited economic opportunity, fuelling gun violence.

<h2>other socio economic disparities</h2>

<div class="para">
    <p>
        Socioeconomic disparities across Chicago are not limited to income. Educational attainment and children receiving food
        stamps is mapped below. Exposure to gun violence can detrimentally students' educational attainment, further reducing
        their economic opportunities, creating a cycle of violence for already suffering communities. High poverty concentration
        can have detrimental implications for the risk of youth firearm-related deaths, with tracts in Austin having over 50% of
        households with children under 18 receiving government Food Stamps.
