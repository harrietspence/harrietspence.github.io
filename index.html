            <h4>Gun violence in Chicago, a socioeconomic study</h4>
            <div class="para">
                <P>
                    The USA is <a
                        href="http://www.businessinsider.com/2nd-amendment-countries-constitutional-right-bear-arms-2017-10?r=US&IR=T">one
                        of three</a>
                    countries where a constitutional right to bear arms exists. Every day, <a
                        href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-violence-in-america/">200 Americans are shot and
                        wounded</a>. Gun violence has become an unavoidable reality of American
                    society.
                    <br><br>
                    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Amendment">1996 Dickey Amendment</a>, motivated
                    by lobbyist group
                    the National Rifle Association (NRA), significantly reduced federal funding for research
                    on gun violence.
                    Despite changes to the amendment, the NRA's political power has hindered research on this important
                    issue. This project aims to use data from non-profit organizations and scholarly research to examine
                    the root socioeconomic causes and impacts of gun violence, with a focus on <a
                        href="https://opportunityinsights.org/national_trends/">social mobility</a>: the
                    ability to move up the income or wealth distribution.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A negative correlation between Firearm Mortality Rates (number of deaths per 100,000
                    people) and per capita
                    personal income for US states is shown below.
                    It must be
                    noted that data here includes deaths by all intent, which can vary
                    significantly between
                    states. For example, <a href="https://everystat.org/#Alaska">Alaska</a> has a higher rate of gun
                    deaths by
                    suicide, while <a href="https://everystat.org/#Illinois">Illinois</a> has a higher rate of gun
                    deaths by
                    homicide. Correlations should be treated with caution when considering the intent behind
                    gun deaths.

                    The top 10 populated US cities are matched with data from the non-profit organisation the
                    <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/"> Gun Violence Archive</a>
                    (GVA), which compiles data from law enforcement, media, and government sources from all 50 states,
                    plotting fatal and non-fatal shootings from 2014-2022.

                    <br><br>
                    Despite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state">restrictive
                        gun
                        laws</a>,
                    Chicago accounts for 57% of all non-fatal shootings out of the top 10 most populated cities, and
                    9% of all cities and counties in the GVA dataset (2014-2022). Illinois is one of seven states
                    requiring permits to buy firearms and is one of five states requiring waiting periods for
                    buying any firearm. This research aims to see if socioeconomic causes can explain their ineffective
                    gun laws.

                    Reported incidents of fatal and non-fatal shootings collected from the <a

                    are shown at neighbourhood
                    levels on an interactive map. Austin, which is Chicago's largest neighbourhood, located far from
                    the city centre,
                    suffers from the most reported gun crimes out of all the neighbourhoods, accounting for 8% of all
                    reported crimes in the 77 neighbourhoods between 2014-22.

            <h2>Mapping income disparities</h2>

            <div class="para">
                <p>
                    Austin has long suffered from severe disinvestment because of white flight, making it a hub of
                    concentrated poverty, shown by its drastically different income distribution than to the City of
                    Chicago. But can poverty be a predictor of gun violence? In the maps below, we can see that
                    neighbourhoods with high gun crimes tend to have lower incomes, but the South-East of Chicago sees
                    low median incomes with relatively low reported gun crimes.
                    <br><br>
                    Social mobility is also mapped, seeing if children who grew up with parents in the lowest 25th
                    percentile of national income
                    distribution can escape poverty. The results here fit the gun crime map more consistently. Climbing
                    up the economic ladder is harder. The once since achievable American Dream is just a fantasy for
                    many people in Chicago, and across
                    <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002978">across
                        America</a>. Structural inequalities, often rooted in racism, mean marginalised individuals are
                    more likely to live in
                    hyper segregated poor neighbourhoods with limited economic opportunity, fuelling gun violence.

                    Socioeconomic disparities across Chicago are not limited to income. Educational attainment and
                    children receiving food stamps is mapped below. Exposure to gun violence can detrimentally affect
                    students' educational attainment, further reducing their economic opportunities, creating a cycle of
                    violence for already suffering communities. High poverty concentration can have detrimental
                    implications, increasing the<a

                        firearm deaths</a>,
                    and as tracts in Austin have over 50%
                    of households with children under 18 receiving government Food Stamps, the neighbourhood is
                    especially vulnerable to youth related gun violence.

                <h2>Data Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the GVA's database query method, only 2000 rows of data could be collected at a time. A data
                    analysist hand
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonmobley/united-states-gun-violence-data-20142022">
                        collected and cleaned
                    </a>
                    comprehensive data, and I collected and
                    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gE2U97aB7KICST_TEVzQ-p0m81bMzc56?usp=sharing">
                        hand
                        cleaned</a> the rest.
                    Data cleaning overcame the issue of city names not being the same in both data sets
                    and aggregated daily statistics into annual data.
                    <br> <br>
                    I initially used API keys for the US census bureau data to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G_yu9nRhShIL_Dv6UgnNsI2rnJ1wrAru?usp=sharing">plot poverty rates</a>.
                    However, the household median income dataset was easily accessible to be downloaded from their database query function.
                    Census tracts in the North-East of Chicago have missing data for social mobility, which is a
                    limitation.
                    However, as this contains the richest neighbourhoods in Chicago and has high educational attainment,
                    we
                    assume these regions are unlikely to be outliers in economic mobility.

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>
                    Correlations, between high levels of gun violence and low social mobility, can be seen in Chicago.
                    However, causality may not necessarily be taken, as socioeconomic measures and gun violence may be
                    two-way causal. Nonetheless, the research here provides beneficial insight into the
                    impacts and causes of gun violence, a pressing issue which deserves further exploration.
